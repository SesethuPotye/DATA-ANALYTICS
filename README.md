# WHAT IS DATA ANALYITICS

data analytics is the whole process of taking raw data and turning it into insights that can be used to make decisions. This involves collecting the data, cleaning it, analyzing it, and visualizing the results.

# several key responsibilities and skills of data analyitics are:

# Data Collection and Preparation:

# Collection:
Involves gathering the data you need for your analysis. This can come from various sources, like surveys, databases, external sources ,social media, or even physical experiments. Here, you decide what information is relevant to answer your question and go get it.

# Preparation:
Is all about getting that raw data(Unprocessed, Unstructured, Unrefined) into a usable shape. This often involves cleaning the data by fixing errors, filling in missing bits, and ensuring consistency. You might also need to transform the data, like converting dates into a standard format, or combining data from different sources into a single, unified format.

# Data Analysis:
Employing statistical methods, machine learning techniques, or other analytic tools to interpret data,
Identifying trends, patterns, and correlations that might not be immediately obvious.

# Data Visualization and Storytelling:

Creating visual representations of the data, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards, to make complex information easily understandable,
Articulating findings in a compelling narrative to communicate the significance of the data to stakeholders.

# Decision Support:
Making recommendations based on data-driven insights to help guide business decisions,
Providing context around the data, including potential implications and future trends.

# Collaboration and Communication:

Working closely with other departments, such as marketing, finance, and operations, to understand their data needs and provide insights,
Effectively communicating complex data findings in a clear and concise manner to non-technical stakeholders.

# Continuous Learning and Adaptation:

Keeping up-to-date with the latest industry trends, tools, and technologies in data analysis.
Adapting to new types of data and analytical methods as the organization's needs evolve.

In conclusin By fulfilling these roles, a data analyst helps an organization make informed decisions that can improve operational efficiencies, drive business strategies, and create a competitive advantage. The goal is to contribute to the organization's success by turning data into a valuable asset that informs and drives decision-making.

# The Analytics Process

Analysts working with data move through a series of different steps as they seek to gain business value from their organization's data.

# The Analytics Process is Iterative

analyzing data is actually a looping process, not a straight line.  You might go through the steps like defining a question, collecting data, cleaning it, analyzing it, and visualizing it, but you might also need to go back and redo a step if you find something unexpected. However The whole thing is meant to be a flexible guide, not a set of strict rules.

# Analytics Techniques

Data analysts use a bunch of different tools and tricks to make sense of their data.  These techniques can be grouped together based on what the analyst is trying to do, or what kind of tools they're using. The passage is basically saying we'll be diving into these different categories of techniques next.

e.g 
* Descriptive Analytics
* predictive Analytics
* Perspective Analytics

# Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the broadest term, encompassing any technique that makes a computer mimic human behavior. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that uses statistical methods to find patterns in data, allowing the computer to learn without explicit programming. Deep learning is an even more specialized subset of machine learning that uses complex neural networks to analyze data, particularly useful for images, videos, and sound.

# Data Governance 

Data governance programs ensure that the organization has high-quality data and is able to effectively control that data.

# Analytics Tools

Software helps analysts work through each one of the phases of the analytics process. These tools automate much of the heavy lifting of data analysis, improving the analyst's ability to acquire, clean, manipulate, visualize, and analyze data. They also provide invaluable assistance in reporting and communicating results.

# SUMMARY
Businesses are sitting on a goldmine of data! Analytics programs help them unlock this value by turning data into insights.  These programs are becoming more accessible due to:

A massive amount of data being available
Cheaper data storage
Powerful cloud computing
This creates a big opportunity for businesses and especially for data professionals who can analyze this data effectively.

Here's the typical process an analyst follows:

Gather data from various sources (internal and external).
Clean and organize the data.
Analyze the data to draw conclusions.
Create visualizations (charts, graphs) to present the findings clearly.
Develop reports and dashboards to communicate the insights to business leaders.

# CHAPTER 2 

# Understanding Data 

This chapter will focus on Understand Domain 1.0:
* Data Concepts and Environments
* Compare and contrast different data types
* Compare and contrast common data structures and file formats

for one to understand data types one needs to understand data elements.

# DATA ELEMENTS
A data element is an attribute about a person, place, or thing containing data within a range of values. Data elements also describe characteristics of activities, including orders, transactions, and events. 

example of data elements

# Tabular Data

Tabular data is data organized into a table, made up of columns and rows. A table represents information about a single topic. Each column represents a uniquely named field within a table, also called a variable, about a single characteristic. The contents of each column contain values for the data element as defined by the column header.

# Structured Data Types
Structured data is like a well-organized spreadsheet. Imagine a table with rows and columns, where each column has a clear heading defining the type of data it contains (like names, dates, or prices). This makes structured data easy for computers to understand and work with, just like it's easy for us to read and analyze information in a spreadsheet.

# most common data types that give structured data its structure.

# character 

This data type acts like a filter for data entry, ensuring only valid characters are entered. These characters can be letters, numbers, or symbols from your keyboard. There are different character data types available, each with its own limit on the number of characters allowed.

# Alphanumeric

Alphanumeric data type is your go-to for storing text that combines letters and numbers. It's the most common type for character data. Imagine product codes (SKUs) in retail stores. These codes often mix letters representing brands or styles with numbers indicating sizes or variations. The alphanumeric data type ensures you can store these SKUs effectively, allowing you to track inventory across different systems.

# NEED TO GO OVER FROM HERE DONT UNDERSTAND AS YET



# Unstructured Data Types
Unstructured data types refer to information that doesn't have a predefined format or organization. Unlike the neat rows and columns of structured data (like spreadsheets), unstructured data is more like a messy attic filled with all sorts of things.

Examples of unstructured data include digital images, audio recordings, video recordings, and open-ended survey responses. Analyzing unstructured data creates a wealth of information and insight. Many people have camera-enabled smartphones, and using video for conversations and meetings is commonplace. To capture and analyze unstructured data, we make use of data types designed explicitly for that purpose

# Categories of Data

The world of data isn't as clear-cut as structured vs unstructured. Semi-structured data bridges the gap between those two categories.

Imagine a spectrum: on one end, you have highly organized data in tables (structured). On the other end, you have completely free-form information like videos (unstructured). Semi-structured data sits in the middle. It has some organization, but not a rigid structure like a spreadsheet. Emails or social media posts are good examples. They might have elements like sender, recipient, or timestamps, but the content itself is more flexible. This makes semi-structured data easier to work with than completely unstructured data, but it still requires some wrangling before analysis.

explanation of the distinction between quantitative and qualitative data!

* Quantitative data: Expressed in numbers and represents measurable qualities. It answers questions like "how many" or "how much." (e.g., height, weight, temperature)
* Qualitative data: Descriptive information, often in the form of text. It describes characteristics or qualities and answers questions like "why" or "what." (e.g., pet name, color, customer opinion)

  explanation of discrete and continuous data

# Discrete data:
is like counting whole things. You can't have parts of things, so it applies to things you can count (e.g., number of pets, number of chickens in whole or half portions).
  
# Continuous data
 is for measurements that can have any value within a range, often using decimals (e.g., height, weight).
Even though age is continuous (technically has infinite values), we often treat it as discrete by using whole years.

This distinction between discrete and continuous data is important for understanding how we analyze and interpret numbers.


Dimensional modeling helps us organize data for analysis! Here's the gist:

It separates data into two main tables:
# Fact tables:
Store the quantitative measurements we care about (e.g., appointment data for a veterinary clinic).
# Dimension tables: 
Provide context for the facts, describing "who, what, when, where, why" (e.g., details on veterinarians, owners, procedures, and pets in the appointment example).

Imagine a fact table like a big basket holding the key data points, and the dimension tables act like labels stuck on the basket, giving details about the contents. This structure makes it easier to analyze the data and answer questions.

# Dimenstional data:
* it is aall about organizing details arouna a central theme.
* It grou[s individual details(attributes) about a specific subject
* Each group, like the "pets" table with pet info, is called a dimension

  Imagine a filing cabinet for a vet clinic. Each drawer (dimension) holds details about a specific aspect, like pets (their breed, age, etc.) or owners (their contact information). When you combine information from these drawers (dimensions) with the main patient file (fact table), you get a complete picture for each appointment.
  
# Common Data Structures

* Structured data needs a neat and tidy filing system (think database schemas) to be useful.
* Unstructured data, like emails and videos, is more flexible in how it's stored.
Analysts juggle multiple tools, so smooth data exchange (interoperability) is crucial.
To boost efficiency, standardized practices have emerged for both structured and unstructured data organization.

Tabular data is structured data, with values stored in a consistent, defined manner, organized into columns and rows. Data is consistent when all entries in a column contain the same type of value. This method of organization facilitates aggregation

# Unstructured Data

* What it is: Descriptive information like images, text, audio/video (qualitative).
  
* Key characteristics: Highly variable and lacks a predefined structure.
  
* Storage: Different from structured data due to its variety.
  
* Importance: Huge potential for businesses to extract value (over 90% according to Forbes).
  
* Example: Machine data (digital footprints from devices) is a goldmine of unstructured data.
  
* Storage Technologies: Utilize unique identifiers to link data elements.

Unstructured data might seem messy, but it holds immense value if we can unlock it!

* Object storage facilitates the storage of unstructured data. The key-value concept underpins the design of object storage. The key is a unique identifier, and the value is the unstructured data itself.

the key is the filename, and the value is the contents of the file itself. Note that in the bellow figure, each file is of a different type. The word document.docx is a Microsoft Word file, textfile.txt contains plain-text data, and the png image.png and lp_image-8.jpeg objects are digital images.

To access the contents of a file, you need to know its key

# Semi-Structured Data

* Think of it as: Structured, but not rigid like a table (tabular).
Example: Emails have a sender, recipient, subject, etc. (structured), but the body and attachments can be anything (unstructured).

* Benefits: Easier to work with than completely unstructured data.
  
* Key feature: Uses tags or separators to add context to the data.
Semi-structured data provides some organization without being as strict as a traditional database.

# Common File Formats

* Different file formats exist to store and exchange data efficiently between various tools and applications.
  
* Some formats have become widely accepted standards, and data analysts should be familiar with these for various tasks.

# Text Files

* Super common data format for computers.
* Plain text only (letters, numbers, symbols).
* No fancy formatting or images.
* Opens easily on pretty much any device (PC, Mac, Linux).
* Also called "flat files".

A unique character known as a delimiter 

* Delimiters: Special characters used to separate data points in text files (like commas or tabs).
  
* Why? Makes structured data transmission easier within plain text files.
  
* Common Delimiters: Comma (CSV) and tab (TSV) are widely accepted standards.
  
* Benefits: Many software programs and coding languages can easily read and write these delimited text files.
  
Exporting as CSV or TSV
