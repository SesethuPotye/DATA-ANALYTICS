This chapter outlines key concepts for creating effective reports and dashboards using data visualization techniques.

# Understanding the Business Requirements

* Who is the audience? Knowing your target audience is crucial for tailoring the report or dashboard to their needs.

* Data access: Ensure you have access to the appropriate data sources for your project.

* Report distribution:
Pull approach: Users access the report from a central location (e.g., webpage) at their convenience.
  * Push approach: Reports are automatically delivered to users 
    upon completion.
